# Titanic Dataset Analysis 

This repository contains the code and analysis for the second task assigned by Prodigy Infotech Companies. The task involves performing 
data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle.

## Overview

The analysis explores the well-known Titanic dataset, which provides information about passengers on the Titanic, including survival 
status, age, class, fare, and other relevant attributes. The primary goal is to clean the data and gain insights through exploratory 
data analysis.

## Key Features

- **Data Cleaning**: The dataset underwent cleaning procedures to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and address inconsistencies
   using Python's pandas library.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: In-depth analysis was performed to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships between variables. Descriptive statistics and data visualizations were used to provide a comprehensive understanding of the dataset.

- **Survival Analysis**: The analysis includes an examination of factors influencing survival rates among passengers.

## Files and Structure

- `EDA on (Titanic Dataset).ipynb`          : Jupyter Notebook containing the code for Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA).
- `train.csv` and `test,csv`: The original Titanic dataset used for analysis.
- `TITANIC DATASET_updated.csv`: The  Titanic dataset after concating.
- `TITANIC_EDA_DATASET.csv`: The Titanic dataset after Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA).
- `README.md`: Documentation which you are reading right now, that providing an overview of the analysis, instructions for replication, and acknowledgments.

## Usage

To replicate the analysis:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/mayurdalvi3003/PRODIGY_DS_Task2.git`
2. Install the required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebooks in the specified order (`data_cleaning.ipynb` and then `eda.ipynb`).

Feel free to explore, modify, or extend the analysis as needed.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Acknowledgments

The analysis was conducted as part of the Prodigy Infotech Companies task, and the Titanic dataset is sourced from Kaggle.
